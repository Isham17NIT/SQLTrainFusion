<h1>SQLTrainFusion</h1>

This project focuses on managing and analyzing train schedules and operations using SQL. By employing various SQL techniques, it aims to solve real-world problems related to train schedules, such as finding trains with specific operational characteristics and optimizing travel times. The project provides a set of queries designed to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.


<h3>Project Overview</h3>
This project involves the analysis of a sample dataset to demonstrate SQL concepts and techniques. The key aspects of the project include:</br>


<h4>1)Foreign Key Constraints:</h4>Ensuring data integrity by establishing relationships between tables, such as linking train_schedule and train_info via foreign key constraints.
<h4>2)SELECT Queries:</h4>Retrieving specific data from tables based on various conditions.
<h4>3)JOIN Operations:</h4>Combining data from multiple tables to gain comprehensive insights. Both INNER JOIN and SELF JOIN were utilized to achieve this.
<h4>4)Subqueries:</h4>Executing queries within other queries to handle complex data retrieval scenarios.
<h4>5)Aggregate Functions:</h4>Leveraging functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG to calculate metrics and summarize data effectively
<h4>6)Time Functions:</h4>Utilizing functions like TIME_TO_SEC and TIMEDIFF to calculate durations and perform time-based analyses.
<h4>7)Conditional Logic:</h4>Applying conditions using operators such as IF for conditional expressions and LIKE for pattern matching, alongside WHERE and HAVING clauses.
<h4>8)Group By and Order By Clauses:</h4>Grouping data based on specific columns and ordering results to gain meaningful insights.
